## Hi, I'm Sonya!

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft and a recent graduate from the University of Washington. I'm passionate about diversity, accessibility, and privacy and security. While in school, I had the opportunity to work on some cool projects, including this visualization of Airbnb listings in 6 major US cities, this online catalog for assistive technology, a SQL injection detector, and a microwave locator. 

Outside of tech, I love crocheting, cooking, and calligraphy. Check out my Etsy shop for high quality handlettered greeting cards!
