		<h1> About </h1>
		<p> I am a student at University of Washington, directly admitted into the Computer Science major. I was a recipient of the National Center for Women and IT
		Aspirations in Computing Award as well as the Google Endowed Scholarship in Computer Science and Engineering. I am also a 2018 & 2019 Rewriting the Code Fellow.
			Currently, I think data visualization and data analysis is pretty cool, but I'm also interested in how society is impacted by technology, whether from a privacy/security lens or an ethical lens. In high school, I was an 
			active student in Cisco Networking Academy, and received by Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA) certification in 2016, and Cisco Certified Networking Professional - Routing in 2017. 
			When I'm not coding away, I enjoy practicing calligraphy and cooking!

		<button class="accordion">Find me a microwave! (in progress)</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p> Project type: Web app <br>
				Description: This project came about after many instances of frustration in not knowing where the closest
				microwave on campus was. I just wanted a hot lunch! So, I decided to build an interactive map of all known
				microwave locations. I used the OpenLayers API for the map, and the Open Street Map layer. 
				I plan to add distance calculations to find the closest known microwave to the device's current location.
				Tech stack: Javascript, OpenLayers API, HTML

		<button class="accordion">inTune</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p> Project type: Web app <br>
				Description: A web app that composed a single-voice melody based on your perceived feelings. 
				The user was prompted to answer the question "How are you feeling today?" and based on their response, our program generated a 
				"happiness index" utilizing Microsoft Cognitive Services API. The index was mapped to one of 22 musical keys and a melody was composed based on 
				chord progresions. If the happiness index was high, the piece was more likely to be in a major key. 
				If the index was low, the piece would be in a minor, and more sad sounding key. <br>
				Team Members: Sonya Lao, Ian Kinney, Christin Lin, Laurissa Lam <br>
				Created at the defHacks() hackathon Feb 2017
