			<p> Project type: Web app <br>
				Description: A web app that composed a single-voice melody based on your perceived feelings. 
				The user was prompted to answer the question "How are you feeling today?" and based on their response, our program generated a 
				"happiness index" utilizing Microsoft Cognitive Services API. The index was mapped to one of 22 musical keys and a melody was composed based on 
				chord progresions. If the happiness index was high, the piece was more likely to be in a major key. 
				If the index was low, the piece would be in a minor, and more sad sounding key. <br>
				Team Members: Sonya Lao, Ian Kinney, Christin Lin, Laurissa Lam <br>
				Created at the defHacks() hackathon Feb 2017
